Then I'll recede, but...

293

As a self-made man myself,

294

I have to express my admiration

295

in your father's footsteps.

Well...

303
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:24,471
Yes, I mean, Walt,
he's done well

304
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:26,974
with what Dad gave him.

305
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:28,007
Not that it matters.

306
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:31,078
But really, Dad hands him
a book twice a year

307
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,279
and Walt publishes it.

308
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:35,448
It's just not the same.

309
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:39,653
But surely Walt runs the
merchandising, adaptations,

310
00:14:39,686 --> 00:14:41,889
film and television rights,
I mean...

311
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,557
Are you baiting me, Detective?

You know he doesn't.

314
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:49,363
And if you think
I am dumb enough

315
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:52,366
to be baited into
talking family business,

316
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,935
into shit-talking
my baby brother,

317
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:56,569
in front of a police detective,

318
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:58,104
and a state trooper...

319
00:14:58,138 --> 00:15:00,274
Walt doesn't run shit.

320
00:15:00,307 --> 00:15:02,943
Because there are no TV
and film rights.

321
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:05,646
Harlan never allowed
any adaptations of his books.

322
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,047
Hated the idea.

323
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,148
No.

324
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:09,416
Yeah!

325
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,117
Drives Walt nuts.

326
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,219
'Cause that's where
the real money is.

327
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:15,589
When Walt would get
a little Irish courage in him,

328
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:17,533
- <i>he'd get into it with Harlan.</i>
- The window is...

329
00:15:17,557 --> 00:15:20,027
Did he "get into it"
at the party?

No. Jesus.

I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.

341
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:45,085
Harlan took you aside
at the party.

342
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:48,188
When you returned,
you were chastened.

What did Harlan say to you?

The Netflix guys,
their business affair guy.

345
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:58,607
He sent something over.
It's hard numbers this time,

346
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:00,367
and I just think
this is a window

347

that's not gonna stay open.

348
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:03,245
We need to take advantage of it

349
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,238
and then you just need to look
at the numbers!

350
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,273
Yeah, Walt, look...

351
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:07,274
Dad! Dad!

352
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:10,143
You... You put me
in charge of our books.

353
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:13,046
Let me be in charge!
Let me do this! Please!

354
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,415
They're not our books, son.

355
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:17,550
They're my books.

356

And this is not how I wanted to
have this conversation.

But you're right, you're right.

358
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:27,260
It's unfair of me
to keep you tethered

359
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:30,163
to something that isn't yours to control.

No, I've done you
a grave disservice.

All these years,

363

I've kept you
from building something

of your own that was yours.

We talked. We had a business

Jesus. It was nothing.

376

You want to talk
about an argument,

377
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:25,185

an argument with him.

I like to keep stuff like this

387
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:45,539
But with Ransom,
he's never had a job.

And Dad,
for some unknown reason,

always supported him.

They have this love-hate bond.
They fight.

Did you converse with Harlan
at that time?

Well, he was there.
We must have spoke.

595
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:37,670
that's weak sauce.
You know that.

596

Lifestyle guru Joni?

599
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:43,919
No, Harlan was supporting her
and her daughter

600
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:45,120
and that's the opposite
of a motive.

She was pocketing
the double payment.

617

Harlan found out,

No wonder.

636
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:56,315

On the night of the party,

somebody who did not want to
be heard climbing those steps,

The other reason I thought

1625
01:08:19,703 --> 01:08:22,106
this gathering
would be, uh, beneficial

1626
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:25,642
is because
Harlan altered his will

1627
01:08:25,675 --> 01:08:27,277
a week before he died.

1628
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:28,645
He sealed it.

1629
01:08:28,678 --> 01:08:31,248
He asked me not to submit it
to the courts

1630
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:32,683
for probate
until after his death.

1631
01:08:32,716 --> 01:08:35,618
So, if anyone is confused
about anything,

1632
01:08:35,652 --> 01:08:38,188
we're all together, we can talk.

Although I don't imagine
any of it

1634
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:42,259
is going to be that complicated.

1635
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:44,328

Um...

1637
01:08:45,428 --> 01:08:46,763
- The house.
- The house,

1638
01:08:46,796 --> 01:08:48,432
Which he owned outright.

1639
01:08:48,465 --> 01:08:49,500
Um...

1640
01:08:49,533 --> 01:08:50,701
$60 million.

Yes. $60 million

from my grandfather.

He lives in fear.

1786

my grandfather was trying

and I know I shouldn't say
this out loud,

1789
01:14:33,076 --> 01:14:34,578

came into the country illegally,

01:27:38,427 --> 01:27:39,594
criminally.

2090
01:27:39,628 --> 01:27:41,530
And you've come
into this inheritance,

01:27:41,563 --> 01:27:43,366
with all the scrutiny
that entails,

I'd be afraid
that could come to light.

And that's what
we wanna avoid here.

you could help me fix it?

with enough resources
put toward it, yes.

Not that that ever even
needs to come up,

2105

Because Harlan gave me
all your resources.

I'll be able to fix it.

2321
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:48,023
Young Ransom just told
Lieutenant Elliott everything.

2322
01:39:48,456 --> 01:39:49,290
Good.

2323
01:39:49,324 --> 01:39:51,559
Wait, I hope he
didn't cover for me.

2324
01:39:51,593 --> 01:39:53,228
Did he tell you the real truth

2325
01:39:53,261 --> 01:39:54,262
about me switching the...

2326
01:39:54,263 --> 01:39:55,263
{\fad(250,250)}<font color="#00abfd">(SIGHS)</font> Yeah.

2327
01:39:55,296 --> 01:39:56,631
- And the disguise bit?
- Yes.

2328
01:39:56,664 --> 01:39:58,266
And the whole blackmail and...

2329
01:39:58,299 --> 01:39:59,568
Mmm-hmm.

2330
01:39:59,601 --> 01:40:02,036
But why did Fran
take my morphine?

2331
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:04,339
I mean, obviously she had
swiped the bag from the house,

2332
01:40:04,372 --> 01:40:06,375
but she didn't seem like
a user to me,

2333
01:40:06,408 --> 01:40:08,677
unless that's why she needed
the blackmail money.

2334
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:10,612
I don't know,
it doesn't matter anyway.

2335
01:40:10,645 --> 01:40:12,514
I have to tell the
Thrombeys myself,

2336
01:40:12,547 --> 01:40:13,591
I feel like I owe that to them.

2337
01:40:13,615 --> 01:40:15,317
I don't think
that's a good idea.

2338
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:17,453
No, I have to do it.
I need to do it.

2339
01:40:19,421 --> 01:40:20,789
I gave the doctors my number,

2340
01:40:20,822 --> 01:40:22,600
so they'll call if anything
changes with Fran.

2341
01:40:22,624 --> 01:40:23,559
All right.

2342
01:40:23,592 --> 01:40:25,494
I'll round up the Thrombeys
at the house,

2343
01:40:25,527 --> 01:40:27,596
along with a police escort.

2344
01:40:27,629 --> 01:40:29,798
For the arrest after.

2345
01:40:29,831 --> 01:40:32,368
You can tell me your whole story
on the drive over.

2346
01:40:33,601 --> 01:40:35,536
I don't want any more surprises.

it was stashed,

"You did this.

01:42:33,354 --> 01:42:35,691
you make
a pretty lousy murderer.

2384
01:42:37,692 --> 01:42:39,461
Perhaps we deserve each other.

You've always been good to me.

the last few days,

2390

that you lost,

to the local authorities
that the manner of death

And what you and Harlan did
that fateful night

2439
01:44:49,757 --> 01:44:52,927
seems at first glance
to fill that hole perfectly.

A donut hole in a donut's hole.

2441
01:44:56,364 --> 01:44:58,933
But we must
look a little closer.

2442
01:44:58,966 --> 01:45:01,970
And when we do,
we see the donut hole

2443
01:45:02,003 --> 01:45:04,371
has a hole in its center.

2444
01:45:04,405 --> 01:45:06,541
It is not a donut hole,

2445
01:45:06,574 --> 01:45:09,510
but a smaller donut
with its own hole

2446
01:45:09,544 --> 01:45:12,480
and our donut
is not whole at all!

this is amusing for you...

and further...

If the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,

2459

they must have known
that Marta was responsible.

2460

An intriguing combination
of factors.

2461

Someone who knew what Marta did

2462
01:45:47,782 --> 01:45:49,417
wanted to expose it

2463

but could not reveal
how they knew.

Fran!

2465
01:45:52,854 --> 01:45:55,657
She was blackmailing me.
She knew what I did.

2466
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:56,991
Yeah, but Fran wanted money,

2467
01:45:57,024 --> 01:45:59,461
ergo she did not want
the crime exposed.

2472
01:46:07,168 --> 01:46:11,138
The answer is not so simple.

2473
01:46:11,172 --> 01:46:15,709
Now with the entire solution
in my field of view,

2474
01:46:15,743 --> 01:46:18,780
the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.

for you to hear.

2476
01:46:24,118 --> 01:46:26,721
But there is at least

2477
01:46:26,754 --> 01:46:29,758
one truly guilty party
behind it all,

2478
01:46:29,791 --> 01:46:32,927
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice

2479
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:36,631
and committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.

2480
01:46:39,467 --> 01:46:40,668
Trooper Wagner.

2481
01:46:40,701 --> 01:46:42,137
Trooper Wagner?

2482

No.

2483
01:46:46,641 --> 01:46:48,809
Marta, I'm so sorry.
I told them everything.

2484

you shared a love of twisting the knife
into one another.

You see, I don't believe

2503
01:47:37,592 --> 01:47:39,059

You can't be serious!

his conversation
with Harlan ended with?

2513
01:47:59,046 --> 01:48:01,616
Harlan told him that
I could beat him at Go.

2518
01:48:10,291 --> 01:48:13,661
There is one
obvious explanation...

2519

You can't be that crazy.

2520

throw away your fortune.

No. I'm giving it to Marta.

2526
01:48:23,938 --> 01:48:27,008
I'm sane for the first time
in my life,

2527
01:48:27,041 --> 01:48:28,085
- and I've done it.
- Harlan, if you think

2528
01:48:28,109 --> 01:48:29,010
I'm gonna let this happen,

I'm warning you!

That's some
heavy-duty conjecture.

2533
01:48:36,784 --> 01:48:38,186
Granted.

2534
01:48:38,219 --> 01:48:42,056
But it is the only way
what comes next makes sense.

2535
01:48:42,089 --> 01:48:44,960
So you storm out,

I just knew.
